# ValkyrIE - Threat Intelligence Engine

ValkyrIE (Valkyrie Intelligence Engine) is a threat intelligence dashboard that collects, analyzes, and visualizes threat data from open-source intelligence feeds with MITRE ATT&CK framework mapping.

## Overview

ValkyrIE is designed to provide cybersecurity analysts with a complete picture of the threat landscape by aggregating data from multiple threat intelligence sources, mapping them to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, and presenting actionable insights. The platform enables effective threat tracking, visualization, and reporting to both technical teams stakeholders.

The tool was built to support threat intelligence operations where in-depth analysis and strategic intelligence reporting are required.

## Key Features

- **OSINT Feed Collection**: Automated collection from multiple sources including AlienVault OTX, AbuseIPDB, and MITRE ATT&CK
- **MITRE ATT&CK Integration**: Full mapping of indicators to MITRE techniques and tactics
- **Threat Visualization**: Interactive visualization of threat data, techniques, and relationships
- **Executive Reporting**: Summary dashboards providing high-level insights for executive stakeholders
- **IOC Management**: Comprehensive management of indicators of compromise
- **Intelligence Reports**: Structured intelligence reporting with linking to related indicators

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Flask
- SQLite3 (included in Python standard library)
- Requests
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- APScheduler

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/MathiasVbech/ValkyrIE_Threat_Dashboard.git
   cd ValkyrIE_Threat_Dashboard
   ```

2. Install required packages:
   ```
   pip install flask requests pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn apscheduler
   ```

3. Initialize the database:
   ```
   python ValkyrIE.py
   ```

4. Load sample data (optional):
   ```
   python load_samples.py
   ```

### Configuration

1. API keys for OSINT sources should be stored in environment variables:
   ```
   export ABUSEIPDB_API_KEY="your_key_here"
   export OTX_API_KEY="your_key_here"
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the dashboard:
   ```
   python ValkyrIE.py
   ```

2. Navigate to `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser

3. The dashboard provides several key views:
   - Dashboard Overview: High-level metrics and trends
   - IOCs: Detailed list of indicators of compromise
   - MITRE ATT&CK: Framework mapping and technique analysis
   - Reports: Intelligence reports with detailed analysis
   - Search: Advanced search capabilities across all data

## Architecture

ValkyrIE is built on a modular architecture with several key components:

- **Data Collection**: OSINT collectors for various intelligence feeds
- **Data Storage**: SQLite database with structured schema for IOCs, reports, and MITRE mappings
- **Analysis Engine**: Python-based analysis of threat data and generation of insights
- **Visualization Layer**: Flask web application with Bootstrap UI components
- **API Layer**: RESTful API for programmatic access to threat data

## Future Improvements

> **Note**: ValkyrIE is under active development. The following improvements are planned for future releases.

### Enhanced Strategic Intelligence Capabilities

- **Advanced Threat Actor Profiling**: Implementation of sophisticated actor profiling including motivation analysis, capability assessment, historical behavior patterns, and prediction modeling
- **Campaign Tracking and Analysis**: Enhanced campaign correlation across disparate data points with timeline visualization and evolution tracking
- **Attribution Confidence Framework**: Multi-factor attribution methodology with confidence scoring based on TTPs, infrastructure overlap, timing patterns, and tradecraft consistency

### Reporting Enhancements

- **Business Impact Assessment**: Addition of risk quantification tied to business impact with industry-specific risk frameworks
- **Strategic Recommendations Engine**: AI-assisted generation of tailored security recommendations based on observed threats and organizational context
- **Dashboards**: Customizable views with stakeholder-specific metrics and visualizations
- **Geopolitical Context Integration**: Incorporation of geopolitical intelligence feeds to provide broader context to cyber threat activity

### Advanced MITRE Framework Integration

- **Enhanced ATT&CK Matrix Visualization**: Interactive heatmap with filtering by threat actor, campaign, confidence level, and time period
- **Attack Path Visualization**: Graphical representation of attack chains and common paths through the ATT&CK matrix
- **Defensive Gap Analysis**: Mapping of observed techniques to security controls and identification of defensive gaps
- **Custom Technique Tracking**: Support for organization-specific techniques and tactics beyond the standard framework

### Technical Enhancements

- **Real-time Analysis**: Implementation of streaming analytics for immediate threat detection and alerting
- **Multi-source Correlation**: Enhanced correlation across disparate data sources using machine learning techniques
- **Threat Hunting Workbench**: Interactive interface for threat hunting operations with hypothesis testing
- **API Enhancements**: Expanded API capabilities for integration with security orchestration platforms
- **Advanced Visualization**: Network analysis visualization for complex threat relationships

### Intelligence Production Workflow

- **Structured Intelligence Requirements**: Implementation of PIRs/IRs tracking linked to collected intelligence
- **Collection Management Framework**: Feedback loop for intelligence requirements and collection source effectiveness
- **Collaborative Analysis Tools**: Multi-analyst workflow tools for collaborative intelligence production
- **Quality Control Metrics**: Metrics and validation for intelligence product quality and value assessment
